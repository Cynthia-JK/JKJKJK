### Personal profile
My name is Cynthia. I am currently studying at **ZWU**. My major is **Art and Technology**. This unique major gives me the opportunity to deeply study and explore the integration of art and technology, and master a series of advanced software tools. In addition to professional study, I have a lot of interests. Music is very important to me, especially Kpop, which is full of energy and rhythm and can make me happy. In addition, I am also a big fan of suspense movies and game shows. The intense excitement of suspense movies and the intellectual contest of game variety always attract me.
